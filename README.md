# Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of laptops based on various features like brand, specifications, and other attributes. The model achieves an accuracy of 92% in predicting laptop prices. The dataset was scraped from the Flipkart website using **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**. The frontend is built with **React**, and **Flask** is used as the backend to connect the frontend with the machine learning model.

## Features

- **Price Prediction**: Predicts the price of laptops based on different attributes (brand, processor, RAM, storage, etc.).
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a prediction accuracy of 92% using machine learning models.
- **Web Scraping**: Dataset is scraped from Flipkart using **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**.
- **Frontend**: Built with **React** for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: **Flask** is used to interface the React frontend with the trained machine learning model.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn 
- **Data Storage**: CSV 
- **Deployment**: Flask app can be deployed using platforms like Heroku or AWS
